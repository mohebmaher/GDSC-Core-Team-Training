High-level overview of the structured workflow for building a machine learning model:

1. Problem definition: Define the problem statement and the objectives that the model should achieve.

2. Data collection: Collect and acquire the relevant data required for the problem statement.

3. Data preprocessing: Clean the data and perform any necessary transformations such as data normalization, feature scaling, and feature extraction.

4. Data splitting: Split the data into training, validation, and testing datasets.

5. Model selection: Choose an appropriate machine learning model based on the problem statement and the nature of the data.

6. Model training: Train the model using the training dataset.

7. Model evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using the validation dataset and fine-tune the model parameters to optimize performance.

8. Model testing: Test the final model using the testing dataset to ensure its effectiveness.

9. Model deployment: Deploy the model into production and monitor its performance over time.

10. Model maintenance: Continuously monitor and maintain the model to ensure it remains effective as new data becomes available.

These steps form a structured workflow that enables machine learning specialists to build effective models that can help solve real-world problems.
